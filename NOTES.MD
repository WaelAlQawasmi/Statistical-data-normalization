- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
z-score normalization process to give you an idea of any value in a dataset from where the faring from the mean.
z-score = (x – μ) / σ ;  x: the value,z=Zscore,μ:mean , σ:standardDeviation

Min-Max scaling: transform  the values in dataset  from where have features are within 0 to 1 or 1 to -1 range .
xnew = (xi – xmin) / (xmax – xmin) , xnew : the normalized data , xi :the value, xmin= minimum value in dataset , xmax= maximum value in dataset

```
- We used Junit5 in our test cases, describe in your own words why would we use such library? 
what is unit testing and why would we use it?

Junit is a unit testing  framework for java, we use it  to verify from small part  of  our code  by check  that the actual execution of our solution matches the expected
 and  for find  if  any bugs exist in the code .

- Mention down any difficulties or concerns you faced while working on the task. Your feedback is appreciated :D.
```
in test numder 2 the standerd divtion is 16.72 but you calculat as it 16.73 so I should have dealt with it as you assumed  it
```

- If you implement any of the bonus points, please mentioned it in this file

- Did this task enrich technical skills or knowledge? If yes, tell us how: 
```
Yes, I increased my knowledge of the statistical processes and the benefit them, as I did a lot of search for them and I bauld codes to calculate it
```
